# Heat Transfer Simulation

Disclaimer: this might be very inaccurate since it differs from experiments done. Or maybe I am wrong from the fundamentals.

By using the rate of heat

where *k* is the thermal conductivity, *A* is the surface area of transfer, *d* is the thickness of the object, and *T* is the temperature. Then, by converting this power into joules, heat change should be equal to the energy given by the rate of heat. The conversion is done by using the specific heat formula.

where *Q* is the energy given, *m* is the mass of the object, *c* is the specific heat capacity, and *Î”T* is the change of temperature.
