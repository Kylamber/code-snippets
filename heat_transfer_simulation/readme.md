# Heat Transfer Simulation

The main heart of this simulation is done by using the rate of heat and specific heat formula.

## Rate of heat

where *k* is the thermal conductivity, *A* is the surface area of transfer, *d* is the thickness of the object, and *T* is the temperature. Then, by converting this power into joules, heat change should be equal to the energy given by the rate of heat. The conversion is done by using the specific heat formula.

where *Q* is the energy given, *m* is the mass of the object, *c* is the specific heat capacity, and *Î”T* is the change of temperature.

## Disclaimer
This simulation might be very inaccurate since it differs from experiments done by me. The reason as to why this simulation differs from the experiments done by me is that, the idealized simulation only cares about two of the objects that are coming into thermal equilibrium. My experiments were done within a thermos container and is very uncontrolled.

## Contributions
Contributions are greatly appreciated in order to find where I was missing in the theory behind the simulation. Experiments that support this simulation would also be a great assurance.
